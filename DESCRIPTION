Title: Fits Autologistic Occupancy Models, Compares Models, and Generates Model Predictions
Description: autoOcc is an R package to fit an autologistic occupancy model, which is a simplified version of a dynamic occupancy model that is espcially useful when dealing with smaller datasets. autoOcc fits this model hierarchically so that different covariates can be used on a species latent occupancy and detection probability. Most of the functions here behave similarly to those in unmarked. In fact, much of the code from unmarked, which is under GPL(>3) license, was modified for this R package. A such, using autoOcc should be somewhat familar to those who have experience with analyses in unmarked.
